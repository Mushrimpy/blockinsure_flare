Narrative:
We all know success of microloans great at helping people expand entrepreneurship
- hard to get approved a loan
- limited capital
- Long waiting times
But what if these were not only resolved, but the system made better, allowing people to predict when they might need capital. That's why we partnered up to build Flareinsure,
 a marketplace for micro insurance contracts secured by blockchain but based real world events with Flare's FDC.
 

 Consider yourself in the shoes of a farmer, who is unsure about rainfall next month, can buy this micro-insurance.
- allow anyone to engage the other side (larger market)
- instant and accurate payout (no bureacracy wiht smart contracts)
- easy, anonymous access to capital.





DEMO: 
How does it work? 2 party system, flareinsure is a marketplace which empowers buyers and sellers of micro insurance. 
- Sellers first create a contract (how many days, what is the underlying (right now is rainfall as a proof of concept, but really is a number, can be anything), premium, etc)
- Buyers then can peruse a range of contract options, find one which is most appropriate for themselves, and then "purchase" the policy by paying the premium to seller
- At settlement date, our marketplace allows ANYONE to request real time data using Flare's FDC which uses our web2 endpoint to verify data and place it on chain.
- Creation, purchase, and settlement is smart contract, so no foul play


Technical
- Button stuff
- Smart contract


BRAGS:
- Although this is a proof of concept with just rain as an important, it is important to note that this implementation is use-case agnostic; it simply allows sellers
and buyers to create insurance policies on some underlying real world data point
- Fully fledged smart contract to ensure safety including rollbacks, identity checks, and defanging re-entry attacks.
- Flare Data Connector (FDC) integration with support for one-click management incuding proposing verifying and submitting and onboarding 
real world data onto the blockchain.

VISION: "FlareInsure leverages Flare's FDC to reinvent micro-insurance marketplaces on the blockchain, 
bringing real-world data to protect farmers and small businesses against unpredictable risks that threaten their livelihoods."

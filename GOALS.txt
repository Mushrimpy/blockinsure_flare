Morning steps
1. Add functionality to change in API (github action/api call)
2. Finish contract selling storefront in frontend 
3. Test with two people on contract.
4. Analytics (total premiums ppl)




4. Vercel (QR code for ppl to play around with during demo.)



Micro Insurance-micro loans (spin it as this)
Democratize financial stability/access
Demo flow (currently)
- person A is a farmer, sees weather forecast is drought tomorrow, looks at our list and takes out weather contract in case of drought tomorrow
- Person B creates policy 
    - Anyone bc blockchain can engage on other side (maybe someone want to make a bit more cash with capital)
    - Instant relief (automatic stabilizer), no need to wait
    - easy, anonymous access to capital (eliminates biases)
- Indeed is drought tomorrow, so Person A gets paid immediately
- Not daily but monthly, which is why we have 7 day window. 

Anything we can build on top?
To Build?
- How hard would it be to use live data? + what benefit?
- Deploying to vercel?
- Transaction history and analytics?

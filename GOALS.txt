Narrative:
We all know success of microloans great at helping people expand entrepreneurship
- hard to get approved a loan
- limited capital
- Long waiting times
But what if these were not only resolved, but the system made better, allowing people to predict when they might need capital. Enter Flareinsure. Insurance contracts based in on oracle real world events on blockchain. Farmer who not sure about rainfall next month, can buy this micro-insurance.
- allow anyone to engage the other side (larger market)
- instant and accurate payout (no bureacracy wiht smart contracts)
- easy, anonymous access to capital.

How does it work? 2 party system, flareinsure is a marketplace which empowers buyers and sellers of micro insurance. 
- Sellers first create a contract (how many days, what is the underlying (right now is rainfall as a proof of concept, but really is a number, can be anything), premium, etc)
- Buyers then can peruse a range of contract options, find one which is most appropriate for themselves, and then "purchase" the policy by paying the premium to seller
- At settlement date, our marketplace allows ANYONE to request real time data using Flare's FDC which uses our web2 endpoint to verify data and place it on chain.
- Creation, purchase, and settlement is smart contract, so no foul play


Although proof of concept, this is fully customizable

VISION: "FlareInsure leverages Flare's FDC to reinvent micro-insurance marketplaces on the blockchain, bringing real-world data to protect farmers and small businesses against unpredictable risks that threaten their livelihoods."
